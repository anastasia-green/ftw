# Fight The World
Game written in C

I made this game as my final project of my sophomore year of high school, in the spring of 2015.

It's like, you know, pretty cringe, because I wrote it in high school. But here's the gist--

It's a text-based adventure game, written in C (Github insists it's C++, but it's not). You play as a protagonist who's obsessed with testing their fighting ability, and solves their problems with their fists. The setting is a post apocalyptic future, where the world has been taken over by a fascist meme enthusiast, but--I promise, it's better than it sounds. I had *some* foresight when writing it, so most of the 'memes' I included were moreso vauge internet trends and concepts, as opposed to a specific meme-of-the-week. Well, mostly, anyway. The narrative voice is pretty solid, and while the story is albiet very much...a product of it's time, the world I created for this story was actuall pretty expansive, and had a surprising amount of lore attached to it. Kanye West was the king of the wild west and, The Beatles were the leaders of the secret police, to give examples.

Every few years I come back to this game and consider revamping it, adding new features and making the story less *2015*. But, I can never bring myself to. Removing all of the 2015-specific meme content would take away a large portion of the original feeling of the game. And of course then comes the question of what to replace it all with. If I were to update it with 'modern memes' the game would have the same problem a few years down the line, and if I get rid of the memes altogether and add more purely original content, FTW just becomes a fundamentally different game. All the specific memes play at least some part in the lore. Some parts can stand on their own pretty well, but if I were to just create a game based off of those alone, it would be a *different game*. Not only that, it probably wouldn't be as *good* of a game. I have other games to make these days, and it just seems like a waste of time to build a game I'm not interested in for no reason.

But, all of that being said, this is the first game I've ever made, and it has a place in my heart because of that. So I'll keep tossing ideas around until I stumble upon a way to revamp this game that doesn't remove the spirit.
